# Single Page Application

I have created this single page application using an already set up fake api : [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) </br>

The App includes a Login and a Register form, once you log in you are able to see a list of users, where you can delete or add user(s).</br>
I have deployed the app to vercel: [https://spa-test.vercel.app/](https://spa-test.vercel.app/)
You should be able to log in with the details below:

```
email address: eve.holt@reqres.in
password: 'any characters you chose'
```

### Built With:

- React
- CSS
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Fontawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)
